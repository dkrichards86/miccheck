# Mic Check

As a student of [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/, I take
regular virtually-proctored examinations through [Examity](https://examity.com/).
Naturally, these sites depend on webcams and microphones for functionality.

Before evey test, I check the webcam and microphone to make sure things are in
working order. This often involves going to sketchy websites. I didn't like that
idea, so I made my own simple webcam check tool.

In the interest of full dsclosure, the JavaScript comes directly from
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)
because I'm lazy.
